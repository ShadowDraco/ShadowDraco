### What does that mean?

- ### Full Stack Developer --> <small><em>Front end + Backend</em></small>
- I write code for websites, and the functionalities on those websites.
- I write servers for websites as well, and I bridge the gap between those places! <em>(That makes it 'Full Stack')</em>
- ### Software Developer --> You name it!
- A more gernal term encompasing other types of applications from phone apps, computer apps, video games and more!
- Software developers often plan things from the ground up to meet needs, and or maintain applications already made


### Why do I code?

- I've always been a developer and an artist
- My hobbies have always been constructive and fulfilling through challenge
- As a developer I put all of my skills and perseverance into action
- Providing a stable life for my future family and remaining consistent is a must

Much of the code that built my foundation in programming is not tracked by GitHub. Though, that quality and time is easily seen in my present, becoming Full Stack Web developer and improving my skills in all categories!
